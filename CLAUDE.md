# MOTIF — Aims, Scope, and Guidelines (for AI agents)

## Aims (what we’re trying to achieve)
- **Primary aim (MVP)**: Let a user search any song name, find real MIDI files online, **load one**, and **play it back in-browser** in a way that feels like a proper MIDI performance.
- **Secondary aim (next step)**: From the same MIDI, generate a **similar-but-different** “Motif” version and play that.
- **Future aim (later)**: Add stylistic transforms (“more ominous”, “dance/remix”), controls, and improved musical intelligence.

## Scope (what is in-bounds right now)
- **Search + ranking** of MIDI candidates from multiple sources
- **Fetch + validate + cache** MIDI bytes via the backend (with SSRF protection)
- **Parse** MIDI and show basic metadata (duration, track count, issues) - now deterministic
- **Playback of the fetched MIDI** (this is the current priority)
- **Error handling**: Clear user feedback when upstream services fail
- Keep Motif generation working, but don't block MVP playback on it

## Guidelines (how to work in this repo)
- **Bias toward real MIDI**: don't silently replace real results with synthetic/mock in the default user path.
- **Make degradation explicit**: if mock/synthetic is used, it must be clearly indicated (UI/logs).
- **Keep changes incremental**: prioritize reliable end-to-end playback over architecture rewrites.
- **Respect browser audio constraints**: playback must work with autoplay policies (user gesture → resume AudioContext).
- **Add practical observability**: when fixing issues, add minimal logs/errors that explain which step failed (search vs fetch vs parse vs playback).
- **Security first**: All URL fetches must validate targets (SSRF protection is enabled). Never bypass security checks.
- **User-friendly errors**: When upstream services fail, return clear, actionable error messages (not generic "something went wrong").
- **Deterministic behavior**: Parsing and metadata extraction should be stable/reproducible across runs (no random placeholders).
- **Definition of done for any PR**:
  - Search returns results for common queries (or clear error if source is down)
  - Selecting a result fetches bytes successfully (or shows a clear error)
  - Playback starts/stops reliably without breaking subsequent plays
  - Security validations pass (no SSRF vulnerabilities introduced)

## "Done means demo-able"
A change is successful if someone can:
- search "Hotel California"
- select a result
- hit Play and hear it
- hit Stop and try another result

## Recent Improvements (2026-02-05)
- **SSRF Protection**: All MIDI fetch endpoints now validate URLs and block private/local targets (localhost, 10.x, 192.168.x, 169.254.x, etc.)
- **Deterministic MIDI Parsing**: Replaced random placeholder metadata with real track analysis (stable note counts, tempo, time signatures)
- **BitMidi Outage UX**: When upstream MIDI sources fail, users see clear retry messages instead of silent failures (returns 503 with actionable message)
- **Verified**: All changes tested and merged to master (commits 5e81227, 686c961)
